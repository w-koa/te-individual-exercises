-- ORDERING RESULTS

-- Populations of all countries in descending order
SELECT name, population FROM country

--Names of countries and continents in ascending order
SELECT name, continent FROM country

-- LIMITING RESULTS
-- The name and average life expectancy of the countries with the 10 highest life expectancies.

-- CONCATENATING OUTPUTS

-- Average Life Expectancy in the World

-- Total population in Ohio

-- Average life expectancy of each continent ordered from highest to lowest

-- Find the names of cities under a given government leader

-- Additional samples
-- You may alias column and table names to be more descriptive

-- Alias can also be used to create shorthand references, such as "ci" for city and "co" for country.
SELECT ci.name, co.name FROM city as ci, country as co
WHERE co.code = 'USA' AND ci.countrycode = 'USA';

-- Ordering allows columns to be displayed in ascending order, or descending order (Look at Arlington)

-- Limiting results allows rows to be returned in 'limited' clusters,where LIMIT says how many, and OFFSET (optional) specifies the number of rows to skip

SELECT name, population

 --ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 10  OFFSET 10;
-- Most database platforms provide string functions that can be useful for working with string data. In addition to string functions, string concatenation is also usually supported, which allows us to build complete sentences if necessary.
SELECT ( name || ' is in the state of ' || district)
AS city_name  FROM city WHERE countrycode = 'USA';

-- Aggregate functions provide the ability to COUNT, SUM, and AVG, as well as determine MIN and MAX. 
-- Only returns a single row of value(s) unless used with GROUP BY.


-- Counts the number of rows in the city table
SELECT count(*) as city_count FROM city;
-- Also counts the number of rows in the city table
SELECT count(name) as city_count FROM city;
SELECT count(population) as city_count FROM city;

-- Gets the SUM of the population field in the city table, as well as
-- the AVG population, and a COUNT of the total number of rows.
SELECT SUM(population) as total_city_population,

-- Gets the MIN population and the MAX population from the city table.
SELECT MIN(population) as minimum_population,
MAX(population) as maximum_population

-- Using a GROUP BY with aggregate functions allows us to summarize information for a specific column. 
-- For instance, we are able to determine the MIN and MAX population for each countrycode in the city table.
SELECT countrycode, MIN(population) as smallest_population,
MAX(population) as largest_population
